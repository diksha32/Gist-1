        android:text="\n\nGreedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
\n\nGreedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property:
\n\nAt every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
\n\nIf a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming.
\n\nBut Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.
\n
\n\nFollowing are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms.

\n\n1) Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): In Kruskal’s algorithm, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.

\n\n2) Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree: In Prim’s algorithm also, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. We maintain two sets: set of the vertices already included in MST and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.

\n\n3) Dijkstra’s Shortest Path: The Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm. The shortest path tree is built up, edge by edge. We maintain two sets: set of the vertices already included in the tree and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the edge that connects the two sets and is on the smallest weight path from source to the set that contains not yet included vertices.

\n\n4) Huffman Coding: Huffman Coding is a loss-less compression technique. It assigns variable length bit codes to different characters. The Greedy Choice is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.\n\n"/>
