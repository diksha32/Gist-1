                "\n3) Crawlers in Search Engines: Crawlers build index using Breadth First. The idea is to start from source page and follow all links from source and keep doing same. Depth First Traversal can also be used for crawlers, but the advantage with Breadth First Traversal is, depth or levels of built tree can be limited.\n" +
                "\n4) Social Networking Websites: In social networks, we can find people within a given distance â€˜kâ€™ from a person using Breadth First Search till â€˜kâ€™ levels.\n" +

                "\n6) Broadcasting in Network: In networks, a broadcasted packet follows Breadth First Search to reach all nodes.\n" +
                "\n7) In Garbage Collection:  Breadth First Search is preferred over Depth First Search because of better locality of reference:\n" +
                "\n8) Cycle detection in undirected graph: In undirected graphs, either Breadth First Search or Depth First Search can be used to detect cycle. In directed graph, only depth first search can be used.\n" +
